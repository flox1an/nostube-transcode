# Video Transform DVM API

This document describes how to interact with the Video Transform Data Vending Machine (DVM). This DVM supports a competitive marketplace flow using NIP-90, NIP-17 (Gift Wraps), and Cashu payments.

## Overview

| Event Kind | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 5207 | Job Request (video transform) |
| 6207 | Job Result |
| 7000 | Job Status / Bid / Feedback |
| 1059 | Gift Wrap (used for private Selection/Payment) |

---

## The Marketplace Flow (Discovery & Selection)

To allow for competition and avoid pre-payment risks, the DVM supports the following flow:

### 1. Discovery (Job Request)
The caller broadcasts a global `kind: 5207` event. To receive multiple bids, do **not** include a `p` tag for a specific DVM.

```json
{
  "kind": 5207,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["i", "https://example.com/video.mp4", "url"],
    ["param", "mode", "hls"],
    ["relays", "wss://relay.damus.io"]
  ]
}
```

### 2. Bidding (DVM Offer)
Available DVMs will respond with a `kind: 7000` status event containing their offer.

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `status` | `payment-required` |
| `amount` | Amount in sats (e.g., `"0"` for free, `"1000"` for paid) |
| `cashu` | The Mint URL (if payment is required) |

### 3. Selection (Caller Trigger)
The caller reviews the bids and selects a DVM using one of two methods:

#### Method A: Public Selection (Free Jobs)
Send a `kind: 7000` event directed to the chosen DVM.
```json
{
  "kind": 7000,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<original-job-id>"],
    ["p", "<chosen-dvm-pubkey>"],
    ["status", "approved"]
  ]
}
```

#### Method B: Private Selection & Payment (Paid Jobs)
Send a `kind: 1059` (Gift Wrap) to the DVM containing a `kind: 5207` Rumor.
*   The Rumor must be directed to the DVM (`p` tag).
*   The Rumor must include a `cashu` tag with the valid token.

```json
// Inside the NIP-17 Rumor
{
  "kind": 5207,
  "tags": [
    ["i", "https://example.com/video.mp4", "url"],
    ["p", "<dvm-pubkey>"],
    ["cashu", "<cashu-token-v3-or-v4>"]
  ]
}
```

## Making a Direct Request

If you already know the DVM pubkey and its price, you can skip discovery and send a directed request immediately.

### Required Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `i` | Input video URL: `["i", "<url>", "url"]` |
| `p` | DVM public key: `["p", "<dvm-pubkey>"]` |
| `cashu` | (Optional) Cashu payment token |

---

## Status Updates (Kind 7000)

Status values used by this DVM:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `payment-required` | Sent as a Bid or if a directed request lacks payment |
| `processing` | Job is active |
| `success` | Job completed |
| `error` | Job failed |
| `approved` | (Incoming) Signal from user to start a free job |

---

## Job Result (Kind 6207)

The result always references the **original** Job Request ID in the `e` tag.

```json
{
  "kind": 6207,
  "content": "{...}",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<original-job-id>"],
    ["p", "<requester-pubkey>"]
  ]
}
```
